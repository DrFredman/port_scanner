# port_scanner
This is a port scanner that is built in Python. At first I wanted to create a standalone program, however I realized it had more potential use if it was a library that you could import. The example python file is an example of how you can use this library within your own programs. 

I do not hold any responsibility with what you do with this library. Remember to port scan only with the target's consent.
